Game Instructions:
Welcome to our Escape Room. We implemented a teleportation based movement system so to move around you can teleport. All puzzles/objects can be interacted with through the laser gun in your right hand and once a puzzle is solved a door will open and the next puzzle will be unlocked. There are 4 puzzles in total and you can go outside once all have been solved.

Theme:
You're a UNC student who has just woken up on the first day of summer break and you're headed to the beach when you wake up and realize that you have been given a suprise exam by your teacher Professor Szafir. He has locked the doors to your house and setup puzzles you must
solve or you won't be able to go on summer vacation and as a bonus he said that if you don't figure out all the puzzles you'll fail the class. Try to complete all of his puzzles so you can pass the class and make it on time for your summer vacation.


Puzzle Hints/Guides

  <summary>Puzzle 1 Hints/Information </summary>
   Press the up and down buttons to increase and decrease the numbers. Numbers go from 0->9 so you just have to come up with and answer to the equation. Each equation may have multiple ways of solving it but any should work and open the door. Sometimes the hitboxes are a bit finnicky so if a number isn't moving try to shoot at it from a different angle and it should work.
